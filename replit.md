## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Tooling**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing instead of React Router
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management, caching, and data fetching

**UI Component System**
- **Shadcn/UI** component library based on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Material Design principles** adapted for healthcare UX
- Custom color palette optimized for medical professionals (primary blue: trust/professionalism)
- Typography using Inter font family for readability and JetBrains Mono for data display

**State & Form Management**
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- Session storage for simple authentication state persistence
- No complex global state management - relies on React Query for server state

**Key Features**
- OTP-based phone authentication flow
- Doctor profile management with image cropping (react-easy-crop)
- Search and filtering across multiple entities (doctors, jobs, courses)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime & Framework**
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the REST API server
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety across frontend and backend
- ESM modules for modern JavaScript patterns

**API Design**
- RESTful endpoints organized by domain (`/api/auth`, `/api/doctors`, `/api/courses`, etc.)
- Middleware for request logging and error handling
- Simple OTP verification without external SMS service (development mode returns OTP in response)

**Authentication & Authorization**
- **Phone-based OTP authentication** via WhatsApp (BigTos API)
- **Development Mode**: Fixed OTP `123456` for testing (no API key required)
- **Production Mode**: Random 6-digit OTP sent via WhatsApp
- **Session Management**: express-session with HttpOnly secure cookies
- **Session Storage**: In-memory store for development (MemoryStore), upgradeable to Redis/PostgreSQL for production
