That’s indeed awesome — and very practical for doctors!
Let’s call this feature “Automate NPA” — a smart AI Tool under DocsUniverse’s AI Utilities section. Below is a full, production-ready plan covering frontend (UI), backend (cron logic + templates), and admin dashboard for managing templates, users, and automation cycles.

🧠 Feature Name: Automate NPA (Non-Practicing Allowance Certificate Generator)
🎯 Objective

Automatically generate and email personalized Non-Practicing Allowance certificates (like the one you showed) every month to opted-in doctors, based on preset templates and their saved profile data.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
1. Database Structure

Table: npa_automation

Field	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique ID
doctor_id	INT	FK to wp_doctor_profiles
month	VARCHAR(20)	Month for which certificate is generated (e.g., "October 2025")
generated_pdf	VARCHAR(255)	File path or URL of generated certificate
status	ENUM('pending','sent','error')	Automation status
sent_date	DATETIME	When it was emailed
next_schedule	DATETIME	Next scheduled run for this user
last_error	TEXT	If sending failed

Table: npa_templates

Field	Type	Description
id	INT	Primary Key
title	VARCHAR(100)	e.g., “Standard NPA Certificate”
html_template	LONGTEXT	HTML content with placeholders ({{name}}, {{designation}}, etc.)
active	BOOLEAN	Active template flag
2. Backend Logic (WP Plugin or Node Microservice)
a. Data Flow

On signup or dashboard → Doctor opts into “Automate NPA”.

Their data (Name, Designation, Posting, District) auto-mapped from wp_doctor_profiles.

CRON runs every 1st of month at 00:05 AM.

Backend:

Fetches template HTML.

Replaces placeholders:

{{month}} → October 2025
{{date}} → 1 November 2025
{{name}} → Dr. Jitendra Kumar Bagria
{{designation}} → Medical Officer
{{place}} → Primary Health Center Goner, Sanganer
{{district}} → Jaipur 2


Converts HTML → A4 PDF.

Saves PDF file (e.g., /uploads/npa/2025_10_Jitendra_Bagria.pdf).

Sends email (and optionally WhatsApp) using Bigtos API (or SMTP).

Logs status in npa_automation.

b. CRON & Scheduling

Use WP-Cron or real CRON via server:

Runs on 1st day of each month (configurable)

Supports manual trigger from Admin Panel.

Option for doctors to pause automation or manually regenerate.

3. Admin Dashboard
a. Menu:

DocsUniverse → Automate NPA

Submenus:

Manage Templates

View Logs

Send History

Doctor Opt-Ins

b. Features:

Upload new HTML templates with placeholders.

Preview generated PDF before sending.

View logs (Success/Failed deliveries).

Send test certificate to any email.

Re-send or regenerate certificates manually.

4. Frontend (User UI)
a. Page: /ai-tools/automate-npa

Sections:

Header: “Never Miss Your NPA Certificate Again 🚀”

How it Works:

Connects your DocsUniverse profile.

Auto-generates every month.

Delivered to your inbox.

Form:

✅ Checkbox: “I want to receive my NPA Certificate monthly.”

Dropdown: Preferred day (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Email confirmation.

Preview Template: Live preview of current month’s certificate.

Download Sample: Button to test current template.

Status Card: “Your next certificate will be sent on November 1st.”

5. Template Engine

Use Twig / Mustache / Handlebars for placeholder substitution.

Store templates in DB with version control.

Example placeholders:

{{name}}, {{designation}}, {{month}}, {{district}}, etc.

7. Future Expansion

Add signature image upload for automatic stamping.

Allow hospitals to bulk-generate NPA certificates for all doctors.

Add WhatsApp delivery via Bigtos API.

Integration with Attendance system (auto verify submission).

8. Tech Stack Recommendation

Backend: WordPress Plugin (PHP) or Node.js microservice connected to WP via REST API.

PDF Generation:

PHP: dompdf / mPDF

Node: puppeteer (HTML → PDF)

Email/WhatsApp:

Bigtos API or SMTP fallback.

Scheduler: WP Cron or system-level crontab.
